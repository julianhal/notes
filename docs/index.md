# Documentation
These are notes I will update with anything and everything I find interesting and useful for infosec.  
These notes were made by copying notes from this repo; [https://github.com/xapax/security](https://github.com/xapax/security), with permission. I will customize these notes with my own notes. 
If anyone wants to copy my notes, you are free to do so.  
I do not own anything in this repo and it will consist of mostly other peoples ideas, resources, links, cheatsheets and tools.
