These are notes I will update with anything and everything I find interesting and useful for infosec. 

These notes were made by shamelessly copying notes from this repo: [https://github.com/xapax/security](https://github.com/xapax/security). I thought xapax notes were pretty good, but I want to update them and adapt them to my needs. If anyone wants to copy my notes, you are free to do so. I do not own anything in this repo and it will consist of mostly other peoples ideas, resources, links, cheatsheets and tools.
